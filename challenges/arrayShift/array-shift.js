// Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.

function insertShiftArray(arr, val) {
  //find the middle of the array. Should account for arrays that contain an odd number of values by rounding up to nearing whole number. 
  const middleIndex = arr.length / 2;

  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

  }
